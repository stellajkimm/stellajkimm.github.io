		<h3>Week 3: Why JavaScript is so Popular in Web Development</h3>
		<p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language that helps make a web page interactive.  So whenever something changes on a page in your browser without you clicking a link, that is JavaScript working it's magic.  It is one of the few programming languages that almost every computer in the world understands and works in your very own browser.  In order for a programming language to do its job, the computer has to understand the language it's speaking.  So why is JavaScript so popular?  First of all, it is ubiquitous in the web world.  How did it come this way, you ask?  Well, when "AJAX" and "Web 2.0" came abut, they used JavaScript in a way to make the web more interactive than it has ever been before.  After this, JavaScript became very popular.  Second of all, it is very easy to learn.  Thirdly, JavaScript is fast and client-side.  Client-side means that the action that takes place is on the user's computer instead of the server's.  This means that you can very well run JavaScript scripts on your computer even when disconnected to the internet because it is not "server-side".  All in all, JavaScript is the bees knees.</p>
