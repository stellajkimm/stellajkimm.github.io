# U1.W1: Get to know your group


## Learning Objectives
- Introduce yourself to your accountability group
- Describe what you learned from someone else's reflections
- Consider strategies for time management and productivity
- Design a plan for getting work done during Phase 0

## Purpose

Despite popular belief, most software engineers work in teams and there is a strong developer community (on the web and locally) for many technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby.  It's important to get used to sharing with each other.


## Directions

### 1. Intro Email

Once you know who is in your accountability group, send everyone in your group and email **and** copy it into your [reflection gist](../reflection.md) with your:

* name
* location
* favorite websites
* learning style

### 2. Share your work
Once you've completed the week's work, send them:
* link to your reflection file
* link to your [USERNAME].github.io site
* link to your wireframe html page

Once you receive someone's reflection, take a look at it and write a comment. Make sure to take a look at your reflection gist to see other people's comments!
