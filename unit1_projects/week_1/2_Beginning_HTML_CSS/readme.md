# U1.W1: Beginning HTML & CSS

## Learning Objectives
1. Create a simple web page from the ground up using basic HTML tags
2. Manipulate html elements using CSS


## Directions

Everything in this challenge is within the context of the [website](../1_Get_Started/2_set_up_repo.md) you set up in the [get started](../1_Get_Started/) section.

### 1. Set up folders

* Create a `unit1_week1` folder
* Within the unit1_week1 folder create an `images` folder
* Within the unit1_week1 folder, create a `stylesheets` folder

From this point forward, all work will happen within the `unit1_week` folder.  All images should go in the `unit1_week1/images` folder and all css files should go in the `unit1_week/stylesheets` folder.
