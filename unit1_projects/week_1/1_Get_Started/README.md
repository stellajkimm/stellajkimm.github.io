# Get Started

Welcome to Phase 0 Week 1! We are starting with web basics (HTML & CSS) and introducing you to Phase 0 process.

## Learning Objectives
Each challenge has learning objectives that describe what you should be able to do by the end of the lesson. Use these objectives to assess your understanding. You will reflect on the learning objectives and material in each challenge. 

## Purpose

### Why Github?

You'll be using Github every day at DBC ... and in your life as a professional developer.  It's how you will know what's going each day, find challenges to work, and collaborate with your team for your Phase 3 project.

In fact, many [people](https://twitter.com/jeresig/status/33968704983138304) in the tech industry see your [Github profile as your new resume](http://code.dblock.org/github-is-your-new-resume).

We want you to get comfortable with git and Github as soon as possible.  We are using the desktop app to ease you into things, but later, we'll transition to the command-line interface.

### Why start with the web, HTML, & CSS?

You decided to attend DBC to become a Web application developer, right? As you probably know, more and more [software is build on the web](http://skillcrush.com/2012/08/08/saas/). Even desktop software ofte syncs with [the cloud](http://skillcrush.com/2012/04/19/the-cloud/). So it's important to get a feel of web development. 


Moreover, the web is fun. You get to combine your knowledge of languages and see a result, but it's also confusing. As a developer you'll have to switch between languages -- HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, etc -- all the time. **We want to get you comfortable with switching between different technologies** :smiley_cat:

## Directions

Complete the following challenges in order to get everything set up to dig into HTML & CSS this week.

1. [Git and Github](1_git_and_github.md)
2. [Set up your website repository](2_set_up_repo.md)
3. [Basics of the Web](3_web_basics.md)

#### Navigating online slide decks

A few of the resources are online slide decks from [Girl Develop It](http://www.girldevelopit.com).  **Navigate using the arrow keys on your keyboard.** Look at the **arrow images in the bottom right** to tell you which ways you can navigate.
