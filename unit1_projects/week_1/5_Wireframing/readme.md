# U1.W1: Wireframing


## Learning Objectives
- Explain wireframing
- Identify the benefits of wireframing
- Wireframe an existing website 


## Purpose

Regardless of whether design is interesting to you or not, web design
matters to end users of the website and business management.  It's
important to know about so you can work more effectively with other
teams in the organization.  On of the first steps in creating a web page
is often to wireframe it. This process should also help you learn to separate different parts of a site (design vs. content, html vs. css, user interface vs. user experience) and learn the process of developing websites.


## Directions
 
 
### 1. Intro to Design Thinking

While designers may be "creative" or "artistic", they are also, like
software engineers problem solvers.  They just solve problems visually
instead of with code.  For some of you, this may come really naturally;
for others it may not.  Either is OK.

### 3. Apply it
For each of the websites you choose for your [comparing
websites](../4_Comparing_Websites/) post, try to backwards engineer
their web design process.  You can choose one individual page for each
site.

Create an html page `wireframe_sites.html` in your `unit1_week1` folder.
Add the following for *each site*:

* In a `<p>` tag, answer: What problem is the web page solving? What visual challenges are
there?
* Create a wireframe of the page.  You can use pen and paper or a wireframing tool.  
* Take a screenshot, photo, or save the file. Then upload the file to an
image sharing site.
* Add the image to your html page.

### 4. Reflection
Go write your [reflection](../reflection.md) and answer the questions!
