		<h3>Week 3: Pairing and Giving Feedback</h3>
		<p>Every unit we are required to do 2 Guided Pairing Sessions and 3 pairing sessions on our own time.  I personally love the idea of pairing and think it's incredibly useful for us.  First of all, it gives us a chance to get to know our Dev Bootcamp family.  Second of all, it gives us the opportunity to learn, teach, and grow by collaborating with other people.  Lastly, it prepares us for the real world when we have to pair with coworkers in the future when working for a company.  It's fun to see other people's style of coding and its interesting to be able to work with different types of personalities.</p>
		<p>After having pairing sessions, we are also required to give eachother feedback.  Giving feedback is definitely an important aspect to pairing because how will you know how to improve without hearing from other people?  It is easy to critique yourself but there is a lot you miss out on if you don't hear another person's point of view.  I have not been able to read any of my feedback yet because I haven't received it yet, but whatever response I get, I'll make sure to take it into consideration.  Writing feedback was a little difficult for me because I felt very comfortable with everyone I paired with.  For the most part, my partners and I have been on the same level of coding ability and worked very well together.  The most difficult part about writing feedback is definitely finding something actionable to say to them.  The only thing I can really say is "keep up the good work and study hard" (hahaha).  Maybe I need to learn to be more critical.</p>
