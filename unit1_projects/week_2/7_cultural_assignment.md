# U1.W2: Cultural Assignment

## Learning Objectives
- Practice sharing vulnerability with the people in your cohort
- Identify your biggest fear
- Describe what you would tell your friend if they shared a fear with you. 

## Directions

###Consider the question: 
**What scares you the most about being at DBC?**

Write an email to your cohort (using the cohort mailing list your welcome email was sent to) that answers this question. Use the subject "Cultural Assignment" if you are the first person. 
If you are the second or later, be sure to **REPLY ALL** with your response. Be sure to do this by **Wednesday**. 

Starting **Thursday**, take a look at your cohort-mates responses and choose one to respond to. Pretend your best friend is saying that to you. How would you respond? Make sure to direct your response to that person. Reply all to the original thread with your response. 

**You will be asked to submit your responses on the weekly submission form**
