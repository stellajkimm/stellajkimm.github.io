# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

I think they are awesome.  Without it, coding would be so much more messy and hard to understand.  We would not be able to share our work as easily because everyone would have a different style of coding.  This way there is conformity.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

Yes it does.  It is clear and understandable.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

Yes.  I like it because it is easier to see what is what in the html document.  Before, using "divs" and classifying each div as footer, header, etc was too much to look at.  THis way is more clear and easier to outline.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

Elements have "default settings" and it is different in every browser.  Reset.css is used to reduce browser inconsistencies.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

Years ago, I used to use Firefox.  Now I solely use Google Chrome so I don't ever see any differences.  I used to have an iPhone so I used Safari once in a while, but mostly used Chrome.  I don't know if it is particularly good or bad that they look different but the differences are definitel things to be noticed as a developer.
