# U1.W2: Technical Blog

## Learning Objectives
- Compare CSS concepts to determine the differences
- Explain how and when to use CSS concepts


## Purpose
Writing blogs on technical subjects is something that will help you solidify your learning and start getting integrated in the community. 

## Directions
Now you get to start using your [USERNAME].github.io website for blogging! Create a new HTML file and call it `blog_template`. You will want to reuse the same blog template over again and create a CSS sheet to style it. This site is your portfolio, so you want to make it professional. Keep updating it and improving it each week to make it something you are proud to show potential employers!

Create a new HTML file and use the date to name it `week2_technical.html`. 

## Topic
Research one of the following topics and write a blog post that teaches others how and when to use each thing. There is no length requirement, but it should show off the knowledge you gained this week. You should show examples of code and screen shots to help teach others!

- What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
- What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
- What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning? 
- What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?


HINT: Intend your blog for a non-technical audience. Imagine explaining to a non-technical friend, for instance. Try to take a person step-by-step through understanding one of the topics above.
