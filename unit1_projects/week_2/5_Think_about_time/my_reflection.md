# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

During the Fourth and Fifth week of DBC, I will be going on a trip to Italy so I will be missing a lot of time that could be spent learning and doing the work for Phase 0.  I also am working full time so I only have the evenings to work on DBC as well.  Time management will be crucial for me to succeed because I only have a few hours of every day to make up for all of the work that I will have to do.

* How will you combat that? 

I obviously have to just suck it up and use any hour I have to spare to work on DBC.  It isn't called "intensive" for nothing.  I really don't want to fall behind so I will stick it out for the next couple months.  I really don't want to be "mediocre" either so I will try my best to go above and beyond.  This will be my main focus for the next 4 months.


* What techniques will you try?
I know my brain is very distracted all the time and I need to learn how to focus better.  I was always interested in practicing mindful meditation.  I tried here and there before DBC and wasn't too successful.  I will try to start with 3 minutes a day and add a minute more every day that I feel like I want to push forward with it, but I don't mind starting small and gradually getting better at it.

I will make sure I am balanced physically and emotionally because that will definitely affect my work.  I am practicing yoga and going to the gym, making sure my body is in shape, which will in turn make my brain more powerful and ready to take on any challenge.

I will also implement the practices in "Intro to Learn Ruby the Hard Way" and practice practice practice until it is engraved into my brain.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My overall plan for Phase 0 is to really make DBC my priority and take any time I can to work on all of the material.  At the same time, I am going to keep in mind that my body and spirit is connected to my mind and keep all of me in shape.  This will include making sure I go to the gym/practice yoga at least 4 times a week, working hard at my full time job so I don't have to take any of that work home (which will give me less time to work on DBC), and really focus on DBC when I have time to work on it.
