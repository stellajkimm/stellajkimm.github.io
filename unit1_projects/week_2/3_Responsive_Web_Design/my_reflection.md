# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a Web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors). (not gonna lie, I took that straight from wikipedia.) I like it a lot because it makes it a lot easier for the developer so that he/she doesn't have to code for every type of device/browser.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Smartphones and tablets changed web design because there are so many different resolutions nowadays since smartphones and tablets come in all different sizes so developers had to adapt to this to make their websites look good in every situation.  In the future, there will definitely be some 3D stuff going on.  That'll blow my mind.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

Hmm.  That's a good question.  There has to be some sort of audible function to it.  We could definitely design and develop for them.  I just have to think a little longer how it would work.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

While watching the "Introduction to Responsive Web Design and Compatability", I was intrigued at how the media queries work.  I understand that that topic is far far ahead of where we are now, but it seemed really cool and interesting.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
