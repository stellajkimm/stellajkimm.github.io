My Website url: stellajkimm.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?

I learned that design and user experience is a lot more work than you think. Design deals with planning the layout while creating a flow of elements on the page, using grids to line up items, wireframing, choosing different font, color, pattern options, etc. User experience deals with what works best with the audience that would make the website the most successful. Whether it would be colors, layouts, speed, performance, etc. There are just so many elements to designing and user experience.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I love the idea of design and user experience. Before reading these articles, I never really thought of how affective a webpage is by all the different factors that designers and UX developers think about. It was fun planning my site, however, the site that we are building is quite simple so it wasn't as hard. I am sure for many companies, their designers and developers go through a long and difficult proccess to find the most optimal layout, color scheme, etc.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

For the design, I looked around other websites to brainstorm ideas and then I branched from the ideas I liked and made my own. I framed things out to make it look like how I wanted however my html skills aren't that great so I had to modify it so it worked well with what I know.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

For now, my website looks kind of plain and boring. I will want to spice it up in the future but I'm not sure which parts I need to change yet. I also think I can use a grid to line up the different elements better and space them out evenly

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

It wasn't so difficult to apply the material I learned, however, like I said, the site we are building is kind of simple, and so are our skills in html. As we grow as developers, I'm sure it will get much much much much more difficult.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
