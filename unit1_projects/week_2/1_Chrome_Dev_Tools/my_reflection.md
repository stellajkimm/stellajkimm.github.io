# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

I'm still a little confused as to what DOM is. I have been reading that it is a "concept" but I am not really getting it. Is the model "concept" kind of like coding ettiquette? Is it just how everything is structured? I think it is the coding ettiquette plus how everything is connected and structured together.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

The wordpress.com site obviously had a lot more going on to it. I noticed that the particular site I went to used a lot of JavaScript. It also had a lot more comments into it. It made me realize that I should but more comments in my work, but to be honest, my work has been pretty simple so there is not much to comment on. But I should definitely make a habit of doing that. Especially on work that I need to collaborate with other people.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

Chrome Web Tools is a lot of fun and pretty easy. I think it is a great learning tool to see what happens live when you change something. It helps you understand each element in more depth.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I never realized how much thought a web developer put into making a web page where he/she would see the rate that the page would load and change the way things are coded to make it go faster. It makes you realize that there is so much more to coding than the aesthetics and functionality.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
