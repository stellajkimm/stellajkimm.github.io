##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS - The "Elements" tab supports this action.  If you edit the coding in the Elements section, the page will automatically change to the new code.
  * Javascript Debugging - "Sources" Tab.
  * Performance Optimization - THe "Network" tab shows you each thing that is being loaded and it's type, size, time, timeline, etc.  This allows you to know what is taking the longest, what file is the largest, etc and help you understand what you can do to make things go faster.

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.

  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.

It is an image.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website?   The largest image is lg-share-en.gif
  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.  You find this information in the Network tab.  You look at the image with the largest size and find it is lg-share-en.gif.  It is 1.6KB and the URL is http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?

I know you have to use Pagespeed to find what can be done to optimize the website but I still don't understand how to find out what is the lowest hanging fruit and how many kilbytes of data can be eliminated.  I am doing a pairing session with one person in my group tomorrow so I will see if he can help me.
