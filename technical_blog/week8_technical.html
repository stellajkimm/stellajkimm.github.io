    <h1>Week 8: Ruby on Rails</h1>
		<p>By Phase 0, we should all already know what Ruby is at this point but here is a little reminder for those who are completely new at computer programming.  Ruby is a high level object-oriented programming language that was created in 1995 by a Japanese programmer named Yukihiro Matsumoto.  When Matsumoto created Ruby, he wanted to make a language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.  Ruby is open source (which means that anybody can download and use it) and easy to learn!</p>
		<p>Ruby on Rails (Rails, ROR) is an open source web application framework that uses Ruby as a programming language created by David Heinemeier Hansson.  This means by using the ROR application, you can create database-driven websites/web applications using the command-line interface, programmed in the Ruby language combined with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  It is a full-stack framework (which means it includes everything needed to create web applications) which is based on principles such as convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY) and the "Model-View-Controller" (MVC) pattern.</p>
		<p>Understanding the "Model-View-Controller" pattern will give you a better sense of how Rails works.  Basically, the MVC pattern is a way of organizing your code.  The web application is split into three sections: model, view, and controller.  The "Model" is mapped to a ruby file that is linked to the tables/databases for the application.  The Model is responsible for storing and retrieving all objects from the database.  The "View" takes data and produces the HTML output for the web browser.  All of the formatting and styles are done in the View.  The "Controller" is the middleman between the Model and the View.  The controller gets information from the Model and hands it to the View to be rendered.</p>
