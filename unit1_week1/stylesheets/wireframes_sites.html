		<h5>What problem is the web page solving?  What visual challenges are there?</h5>
			<p>Soundcloud is an online audio distribution platform that allows members to share music.  A lot of the users promote their own productions by uploading it on soundcloud and allowing people to "like" or repost their work.  Soundcloud allows lesser known producers (and even mainstream producers) promote their music and put themselves out there.  Most of the content in soundcloud is music.</p>
