			<h2>soundcloud.</h2>
			<h5>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</h5>
			<p>Soundcloud.com is one of my favorite websites because one of my favorite things to do is discover and listen to new music.  Soundcloud allows users to "like", repost, and upload music.  You are also able to "follow" other user's soundcloud page to see what they liked/reposted/uploaded so it is easier to find more music and listen to what your friends are listening to.</p>
			<h5>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage?  Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now?  Is that the area the most important area of the site?</h5>
			<p>The first thing that catches my eye are the actual soundwaves of the songs.  After standing back further, my eyes are still drawn to the soundwaves.  The soundwaves basically take up most of the website.  This is important because most of the content on Soundcloud is based around the actual "sounds" so the website was designed well.</p>
			<h5>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives.</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>orange</li>
				<li>organized</li>
				<li>repetitive</li>
				<li>clean</li>
				<li>visual (in terms of showing how the sounds actually look like)</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>What problem does this website solve?  What content does it have?</h5>
			<p>Soundcloud is an online audio distribution platform that allows members to share music.  A lot of the users promote their own productions by uploading it on soundcloud and allowing people to "like" or repost their work.  Soundcloud allows lesser known producers (and even mainstream producers) promote their music and put themselves out there.  Most of the content in soundcloud is music.</p>
			<h5>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site?</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>music-oriented</li>
				<li>sociable</li>
				<li>creative</li>
				<li>original</li>
				<li>promotional</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage?  How about from another page?</h5>
			<p>It's easy to navigate anywhere because the header has a navigation menu that allows you to get anywhere you want in soundcloud.</p>
			<h5>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</h5>
			<p>Very easy.  The header has a navigation menu where you can get anywhere.  Also, on the top center of the page, there is a magnifying glass that is a button to search for any artist/song/user you want so it is easy to navigate through the site.</p>
			<h5>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?</h5>
			<p>Amazing.  I wish I could stay on it for hours and hours.  I usually have it open while surfing the internet and have the music play in the background.  But there is just so much music to listen to and it is never ending so I could be on soundcloud forever.</p>
			<h5>Does the site sell anything?  If so, have you purchased any of it?  Why or why not?</h5>
			<p>No.</p>

			<h2>beatport.</h2>
			<h5>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</h5>
			<p>Similar to Soundcloud, Beatport is one of my favorite sites because I love discovering new music and Beatport is kind of the "Billboard" for Electronic Dance Music.  It's awesome because it shows you the ranking of all of EDM in each genre showing which songs are the hottest at the moment.  It allows you to preview songs and also purchase them if you like them enough</p>
			<h5>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage?  Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now?  Is that the area the most important area of the site?</h5>
			<p>The left center with the biggest picture draws my attention first.  It covers the largest area of the homepage and is also changing every 2-3 seconds so it grabs your attention first.  Standing further back,  the center of the page attracts my attention first (which is the 3 smaller pictures next to the larger picture.  They attract me first because it is in the immediate center of the page.  The center of the page is not the most important.  Actually I never even click on those parts of Beatport.  The most important (in my opinion) are the "TOP 100" lists which is not shown directly on the front page.</p>
			<h5>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives.</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>cluttered</li>
				<li>noisy</li>
				<li>neon</li>
				<li>boxy</li>
				<li>fun</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>What problem does this website solve?  What content does it have?</h5>
			<p>This website allows viewers to know what tracks are most popular at the moment and gives news on new releases and tracks that djs are promoting.  The content is mostly mp3s that are being released and song charts.</p>
			<h5>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site?</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>informative</li>
				<li>musical</li>
				<li>cultural</li>
				<li>promotional</li>
				<li>varietal</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage?  How about from another page?</h5>
			<p>It is pretty easy because the header has a navigation menu allowing you to access different parts of the site.</p>
			<h5>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</h5>
			<p>There is a lot of content because there is so much music being released every day.  It is kind of difficult to get through most of the content because there is so much going on in the website and too much to look at at one time.</p>
			<h5>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?</h5>
			<p>I feel a little distracted because there is just too much on the page at once that I get tired of looking at everything and searching for what I want to actually see.</p>
			<h5>Does the site sell anything?  If so, have you purchased any of it?  Why or why not?</h5>
			<p>Yes, it sells the mp3s that are being promoted.  I have never bought any of the mp3s because I listen to music through Spotify (which I pay for monthly) so I don't need to buy mp3s from Beatport.</p>

			<h2>soundisstyle.</h2>
			<h5>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</h5>
			<p>Similar to Soundcloud and Beatport, I like soundisstyle.com because it is a blog that promotes new music.  I particularly like the musical content promoted through this website so I like listening to suggestions given.</p>
			<h5>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage?  Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now?  Is that the area the most important area of the site?</h5>
			<p>My eyes are first drawn to the header because it is bright red.  Standing back, the focus is more on the picture underneath the navigation panel.  I cant really say what is the most important area of the site because there are so many parts to it, but I can say that the center picture is not the most important area of the site.</p>
			<h5>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives.</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>boxy</li>
				<li>crowded</li>
				<li>unorganized</li>
				<li>distracting</li>
				<li>sharp</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>What problem does this website solve?  What content does it have?</h5>
			<p>It informs you of new music and news about music in blog form.</p>
			<h5>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site?</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>informative</li>
				<li>promotional</li>
				<li>musical</li>
				<li>varietal</li>
				<li>stimulating</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage?  How about from another page?</h5>
			<p>Pretty easy because of the navigation panel.  There is also a search button.</p>
			<h5>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</h5>
			<p>Same as above.</p>
			<h5>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?</h5>
			<p>It's a little too hectic for my taste.  Any page you go on, there is something else to look at rather than the things you actually want to read so it is really distracting.  I can't stay on one page in soundisstyle for too long because I get too distracted by other headlines.</p>
			<h5>Does the site sell anything?  If so, have you purchased any of it?  Why or why not?</h5>
			<p>No.</p>
