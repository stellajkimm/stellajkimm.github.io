		<h5>What problem is the web page solving?  What visual challenges are there?</h5>
			<p>Soundcloud is an online audio distribution platform that allows members to share music.  A lot of the users promote their own productions by uploading it on soundcloud and allowing people to "like" or repost their work.  Soundcloud allows lesser known producers (and even mainstream producers) promote their music and put themselves out there.  Most of the content in soundcloud is music.  Visual challenges is that there are two types of users for soundcloud: listeners and promoters.  Users can be both but they are typically more of one than the other.  The designer has to develop the website so that it is optimal for both type of users.</p>

		<h5>What problem is the web page solving?  What visual challenges are there?</h5>
		<p>This website allows viewers to know what tracks are most popular at the moment and gives news on new releases and tracks that djs are promoting.  The content is mostly mp3s that are being released and song charts.  The visual challenge is that there is so much information that is given from this website so the designer has to choose which content is the most important for the viewer to see first.  Beatport has a lot of little things going on everywhere and is a pretty complex website so the designer has to display it in an organized fashion.</p>

		<h5>What problem is the web page solving?  What visual challenges are there?</h5>
		<p>It informs you of new music and news about music in blog form.  Visual challenges include that similar to beatport, there are a lot of different topics going on in this website so there is a lot to fill in the home page.  However, looking at the wireframe of this section of the website, it only includes the navigation bar and the header which is pretty simple.  This part of the display is obviously focused on the header, which is the logo of the website and then the navigation bar.</p>
