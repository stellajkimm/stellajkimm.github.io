		<h3>Week 6: Object Oriented Programming vs. Functional Programming</h3>
		<p>During our time in DBC, we have been learning how to code in Object Oriented Programming and never really heard or used the term Functional Programming.  After some research, this answer on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2078978/functional-programming-vs-object-oriented-programming">Stackoverflow</a> explained the difference to me in the easiest comprehesive way possible:</p>
		<p><scan class = purple>"Object-oriented languages are good when you have a fixed set of operations on things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new things. This can be accomplished by adding new classes which implement existing methods, and the existing classes are left alone.  Functional languages are good when you have a fixed set of things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new operations on existing things. This can be accomplished by adding new functions which compute with existing data types, and the existing functions are left alone."</p>
		<p>So it all comes down to... WHICH ONE IS BETTER?  Or WHICH ONE SHOULD I USE?  This has become a big debate online for many programmers and there are a lot of opinions out there on which is more efficient.  In my opinion, I think they are both good at what they do and it's hard to say which one is necessarily "better".   Like it is written in the Stackoverflow quote, it all really depends on your situation.  I am still a beginner and haven't played with Functional programming yet, so I may be incorrect when I say this, but it would seem like Object Oriented programming would be better when it comes to developing interactive websites, whereas Functional programming would be better with analyzing databases for companies.</p>
