# U2.W4: Cipher Challenge


# I worked on this challenge with: .



# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing. 
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.



# def north_korean_cipher(coded_message)
#   input = coded_message.downcase.split("") # Check out this method in IRB to see how it works! Also refer to the ruby docs.
#   decoded_sentence = []
#   cipher = {"e" => "a",   # This is technically a shift of four letters...Can you think of a way to automate this? Is a hash
#             "f" => "b",   # the best data structure for this problem? What are the pros and cons of hashes?
#             "g" => "c", 
#             "h" => "d",   # there is definitely an easier way to do this.  maybe doing a loop of the alphabet to 
#             "i" => "e",   # assign the value of the hash.  or instead of having a hash in general, make an iteration
#             "j" => "f",   # to switch the character.
#             "k" => "g",
#             "l" => "h",
#             "m" => "i",

#                          # it starts with false because if there was no match, the method would add the x to the decoded sentence in the end.
#                          # this just gives the method an option if there was no match.  if it were true, the code wouldnt do anything
#                          # to the unmatched character
#     cipher.each_key do |y| # What is #each_key doing here? it is taking each key and comparing it with the input character x

#                  # x is the character in consideration from input, y is each key in cipher. it is seeing if the x character
#                  # has a cipher match.

# Reflection
#
# Not really sure what it means by clean up variable names.  I think they look fine(?) but I could be wrong?.
# Instead of having a hardcoded hash, I changed it so that it looks up x's ord number and replaces it with a character
# with a different ord number.  I am quite sure I can refractor this again or do it in a more eloquent way
# but this is just how I thought of it.  I couldn't think of a better way to go to shift characters.  Either way,
# the code works.  Ultimately just used ruby-doc.org to help me out with methods I can use.  This challenge was pretty
# fun and it's important to know that there is always probably a better way to write something with less coding.
