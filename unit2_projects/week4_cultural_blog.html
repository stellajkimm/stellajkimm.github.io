		<h3>Week 4: Dealing with Conflict</h3>
		<p>In our lives, we must constantly deal with conflict, whether it is conflict with yourself, conflict with others, conflict with situations at hand, etc.  Whatever it is, it's a tough thing to go through and many times, people don't know how to go about solving the conflict and regret the initial actions they took when dealing with it.  I think the most important thing to do before acting is thinking things through in a calm matter and not make decision when you are heated or in the heat of the moment.  I think we can all agree that we made some pretty lousy decisions when we were mad and didn't think through the consequences thoroughly.  When dealing with conflicts, you should always consider how the outcome of your decision is going to effect you, other people, and the situation in general and if you are okay with what might happen.</p>
		<p>One conflict I had in the past was with a coworker who I was working on a project with.  The project was time sensitive and he just wasn't performing the way I expected him to.  Initially, I was annoyed and as time passed and the due date came closer, I just couldn't surpress my anger any longer and shouted at him for holding me back on the project.  He felt very sorry for his actions and tried harder, but our relationship became tense.  Immediately after, I felt sorry for yelling at him about it and rethought the situation.  If I had just asked him to put in more effort earlier, maybe this wouldn't have happened.  Or if I calmly discussed the reasons why I was upset and tried to find a solution together with him, our relationship wouldn't be as tense.  I mean, this is a guy that I will be working with on many more projects in the future, so having a bad relationship is not exactly the best thing.  After realizing this, I apologized to him for being rude and inconsiderate of his feelings and that I would try harder to solve the issues in a more respectful manner.  He completely understood and we still have a good relationship.</p>
		<p>When dealing with conflict, you must always think about how your actions are going to affect you and others in the future and realize what the best outcome would be through your actions.  When you are dealing with a conflict, it is not only involving you, but others around you.  In order to solve conflicts in a respectful matter, it is important to think rationally and calmly before taking action.  By doing this, you will avoid even more conflicts in the future.</p>
