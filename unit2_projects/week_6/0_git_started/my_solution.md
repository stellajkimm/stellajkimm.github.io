## Release 5: Reflection

# Using the terminal is still uncomfortable for me, but I am getting better at it after this challenge.
# I am still scared of it but it will only become more comfortable with practice.  I will try to go all
# week without using the GitHub app.  It's hard to remember all of the commands but it makes more sense on what
# is happening when you put it through the terminal because you can see it actually happening and the
# computer's response to it.
