		<h3>Week 6: Stereotype Threat</h3>
		<p>Stereotype threat is an issue that many people in this world face without even realizing it.  If you ever thought negatively about yourself because of your beliefs of the stereotypes of your own race, you have experienced stereotype threat.  It does not only cause internalized racisim/sexism toward oneself but moreover, self-deprication that leads to negative outcomes.  To be honest, in my opinion, there is no real way around getting rid of stereotypes.  They will always be there and probably there for a reason.  But stereotypes are just that.  Stereotypes.  A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.  It does not apply to everyone, and should not be, but either way, it affects the way people think about eachother and themselves.</p>
		<p>I've experienced stereotype threat a million times, and I guess I didn't even realize it until I started writing this blog post.  When I got my license at 16 years old, I thought I was a pretty decent, if not GREAT driver.  At the time, I was one of the first to get my license in my friend group because I am a January baby.  For a couple years after, I never got into an accident and I drove pretty smoothly without anyone ever complaining about my driving.  I always heard the stereotype "Asian Driver, No Survivor" and how especailly Asian WOMEN drivers are the worst, but I never really thought it pertained to me.  However, as time went on, people kept mentioning the phrase to me and any hiccup or small incident where I would almost (but not quite) get into an accident, I would foolishly and jokingly say to myself, "Haha! It's because I'm an Asian woman driver."  I think the fact that I would say to this myself and to my friends gave them and me more of a reason to actually think I was a bad driver.  And when you think you are a bad driver, most likely you will lose your confidence while driving and be even more scared to drive, which makes your driving increasingly worse.  It's a downward spiraling effect that is difficult to get out of.  Even looking back now, I don't even know if I was always a bad driver or I just became worse and worse because I thought I was.  Either way, by looking at my driving record and the shameful amount of tickets/accidents I had to pay for in the past ten years, I can confirm that I am definitely a bad driver.  But the reason behind it is fuzzy because I might have just been affected by stereotype threat!  (Or... am I just using that as an excuse to my horrible driving? HAHA!  We'll never know.)</p>
		<p>Bottom line is, it is difficult to get yourself to think outside of stereotypes, but the only solution here is to remember that you can change your reality by what you believe.  And if you believe yourself to become a good driver, you will become a good driver.  If you believe that you will be good at academics despite stereotypes of your race/sex, you will be good at academics (as long as you try your best I suppose...).  And the only way to help others along the way is to try and not put stereotypes on everything.  Encouragement and support go a long way.</p>
