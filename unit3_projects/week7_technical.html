		<h3>Week 7: SQL vs NoSQL</h3>
		<p>Ever since NoSQL emerged and evolved in the technological world, there has been a long debate whether SQL or NoSQL was the better database management option.  SQL is a relational database management system thats main focus is ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability).  NoSQL (or Not Only SQL) is a database management system thats main characteristic is it's non-adherence to relational database concepts.  There are many differences between the two but what really is important is which one you should use for your application.</p>
		<p>When data validity is super important to you and when you need to support dynamic queries, SQL is the choice for you.  It is geared towards joins, filters, and aggregations so if the data has a simple tabular structure, like an accounting spreadsheet, then the relational model is more adequate.  The fallback with SQL though is that with large amounts of data, it could lead to slow responsive time, especially with joins in relational databases with millions of users and lookups. </p>
		<p>When your data is more complex such as geo-spatial, engineering parts, or molecular modeling with multiple levels of nesting, NoSQL may be a better option since this type of data does not fit into that two-dimensional row-column structure naturally.  NoSQL is also suited more for those who handle huge volumes of data.</p>
		<p>In my opinion, SQL and NoSQL equally sound extremely intriguing to me and I am excited to learn about both of them.  I have already worked with SQL a little in my previous job and never with NoSQL so I am a little more interested in seeing how NoSQL works.  I can see how each of these have their advantages and disadvantages and agree that in some cases, one works better than the other.  A vast majority of companies already use relational databases, but as technology evolves, NoSQL has been proven to be more effective in some cases.  But overall, I believe that they should and will coexist for many years to come.</p>
