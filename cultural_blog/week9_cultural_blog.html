    <h1>Week 9: Gregoric Thinking Style</h1>
        <p>In the beginning of Phase 0, we took a personal thinking style quiz to see which type of <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregoric Thinking Style</a> we are.  I retook this quiz again and got pretty strange results.  For Concrete Sequential I had 24 points, Abstract Sequential 4 points, Abstract Random 28 points, and Concrete Random 4 points.  Basically I am highly Concrete Sequential and highly Abstract Random, which are the complete opposite of each other.  When I saw this, I thought there might be something wrong with my answers, but I retook it again and obviously I ended up with the same result.</p>
        <p>So what does this tell me?  Well, I looked up the characteristics of both of these thinking styles and tried to see which one I thought was more me.  Concrete Sequential learners work best when they have exact directions and examples, know the accepted way of doing things, apply ideas in a practical hands-on way, and have guided practice with an organized person.  Abstract Random learners have assignments requiring personalization, have social activities to balance work, have freedom from control by others, use personal, individual, or artistic expression, have open communication with others, and have a noncompetitive atmosphere.  Looking at both of these descriptions, both fit me very well and I can't exactly say which thinking style is me.  This tells me that I am pretty adaptable to many work settings.  Although I love order and learn well when I have guided practice and direction, I am also able to learn in an open and abstract environment.  I work well in both ways and to think about it, I don't think I would work well if I didn't have both environments in my life.  A Concrete Sequential learning environment would be very productive, but it would become boring and I may lose interest.  An Abstract Random learning environment would be fun and engaging but I might not be able to learn as well as in a Concrete Sequential learning environment.  I need both of these environments to balance out my work life.</p>
        <p>Phase 1 is around the corner and so it is time for us to put our thinking styles in to good use.  The fact that I have such polar opposite styles of thinking, I know that whatever environment DBC throws at us, I will be able to adapt to it and still have a great potential to learn and grow.  I hope that DBC will give us both Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random environments to let our skills develop in different ways.  I'm ready and extremely excited for any challenge DBC has to offer! :)</p>
