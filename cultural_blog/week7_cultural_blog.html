    <h1>Week 7: Reaffirming values in the midst of Stereotype Threat</h1>
		<p>Accomplishment, close relationships, having a family, meaningful work, and personal development.  During Week 2 of Phase 0, we were asked to point out the values that were most important to us and these were the values that I believe to be the most significant in my life.  Looking back, not only can I say that I've held these values true, but these were the values that held me together in the midst of trials and tribulations.</p>
		<p>This month has been extremely stressful for me because I have been balancing my full-time job, DBC and my close relationships.  I just recently had my last day of work this past Friday, which is a great load off my shoulders, but in the past month, I have been working hard to give my all to my last month with my company.  I knew that DBC should have been my main focus, but I always like finishing my projects with a bang, and I did not want to make my efforts despite leaving my company any different.  At the same time, I wanted to do really well during Phase 0 because this is where my future lies.  And on top of all of this, I was struggling with time with my close relationships, because they are dear to my heart and unfortunately some of these relationships have been hindering.  It is really tough to juggle so many things at once, especially if there are so many things you care about.  It's hard to choose which one to really focus on.  It is often a balancing/juggling act that seems impossible to keep up without struggling.  I say that these values held me together through trials and tribulations, but really, they were my trials and tribulations.  But no matter how much I stress about it, I know that I stress for a reason and it is because these are the values that I truly cherish and only great things will happen in the future if I keep focusing on what I care most about.  If I focus on my career (accomplishments, meaningful work), this will ultimately lead to the success and personal development I strive for.  If I focus on my close relationships and having a family, this is what I know will truly give me happiness.  If my mind is already so occupied on these things, no other problem will even hinder my heart because they are nothing compared to these 5 values.  These are my focus, and these are my life.  Nothing else can tear me down.</p>
