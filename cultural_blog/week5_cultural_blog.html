    <h1>Week 5: Problem the Tech World Faces</h1>
		<p>There are many many issues that the tech world faces today.  Originally, the tech world was made to solve problems, and that, it did.  But after further development of this complex and demanding technological world that we live in, we tend to create more problems than we can actually solve and gives us a sense of wanting more, even though we were given quite a lot already.  To be honest, after looking at all of the problems in the tech world, I think the biggest problem that we face is ourselves and how dependent we are on technology.  Technology is becoming way too present in our lives.   The technological world was meant to enhance our lives and make it more convenient, however, the rapid development lead to humans becoming dependent, lazy, and anti-social.  We rely too much on searching the web or communicating through the internet than using our skills in the real world.  Coming from a person who wants to get a job in the tech world, I understand the worth of all of this development and can see the bright future it has onward.  Especially coming from a girl that grew up in Generation Y that can't leave the house without my cellphone, I can definitely see my dependence on the little piece of metal and plastic.  I admit fully that I would be completely lost without my cellphone's battery life, figuratively and literally.  With that, I mean I have no sense of direction and without Google Maps, I would be totally stranded.  But this probably wouldn't have been the case had I not been so dependent on technology.  I think many people can relate to this and account one of their own stories about a time they felt stranded without technology.  So what I'm trying to say is, there may be a lot of issues in the tech world, but the biggest issue is not the tech world, but the people who use it.</p>

		<p>This becomes a huge problem where people become incredibly dependent on technology, greedy, and extremely lazy.</p>
