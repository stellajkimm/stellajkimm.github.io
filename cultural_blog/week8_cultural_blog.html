    <h1>Week 8: Chefs in the Kitchen</h1>
		<p>It's been 8 weeks since Phase 0 started and I am ecstatic about starting Phase 1 next week.  I know it's going to be a lot of work and I know I will probably be really stressed, but it will all be worth it in the end.  When DBC members tell me to say goodbye to my loved ones and my hobbies, I take that seriously and I know that I am going to put all my energy on making this work.  I've done it before when I became an actuary with actuarial exams.  Granted, that was three years ago and I had a lot more energy.  But I know this experience will be a similar type of high, especially knowing what my potential can be and looking forward to seeing where I end up in the future.  I have high hopes for the next two months because we all know that the amount of effort put in this time will be life changing.</p>
		<p>Ever since I was introduced to DBC, I was extremely impressed at the fact that not only does DBC focus on technical skill, but also emphasize the importance of empathy and improvement of self in all aspects.  I love how DBC encorporated mindful meditation, yoga, cultural blogs and stress exercises to their curriculum because it shows that DBC not only cares about us succeeding as programmers, but also lifting us higher as people.  Already, meeting fellow cohorts through pairing and the Google community during Phase 0 really inspired me and made me really look forward to meeting these brilliant people who will go through this journey with me.  I know I will encounter many different personalities and that it will be a challenge for me to understand and embrace working with each type of person, but this is an exciting aspect on its own.</p>
		<p>Another thing I know is that DBC hasn't been around for that long so they are constantly looking for ways to improve their curriculum and culture.  I am excited to be part of the process and I know that my experience is what I make it, so I will put all my effort to making my own experience as amazing as it can be and also mold the experiences of future cohorts.  One more week til Phase 1!  See you all on the other side!</p>
